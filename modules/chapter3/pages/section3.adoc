he blog post introduces Phi-3, a family of open AI models by Microsoft, designed to redefine what is possible with small language models (SLMs). Phi-3 models are the most compatable and cost-effective SLMs, outperforming models of the same size and even larger ones in language, reasoning, coding, and math benchmarks. The Phi-3-mini model, with 3.8 billion parameters, is available on Microsoft Azure AI Studio, Hugging Face, and Ollama, supporting context windows for up to 128K tokens. These models are optimized for various hardware, including NVIDIA NIM microservices. Additional models, Phi-3-small (7B) and Phi-3-medium (14B), will be available soon.
