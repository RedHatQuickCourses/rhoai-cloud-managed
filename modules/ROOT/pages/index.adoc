= Red Hat AI on AWS Cloud
:navtitle: Home

== Introduction

This course is intended for Red Hat Technical Sales, Solution Architects, Support and Service team members who are discussing Red Hat AI platform solutions with customers who utilize AWS cloud services or have the flexibility to use AWS cloud services to provision such environments.

Waiting for on-premises hardware can take weeks or months, which is why obtaining Red Hat AI Platforms from Cloud providers, AWS specifically in this course, in minutes can be a crucial component for unlocking the full potential of *generative AI* and *predictive AI* for organizations on the move.

Utilizing on-demand cloud resources to evaluate, experiment and fine tune open-source  AI models can allow organizations to avoid purchasing high-cost GPUs used for model training and inference; instead using accelerators & Red Hat AI plaforms hourly and shutting down research and development projects when complete.

This course will focus only on Red Hat AI solutions that can be instantiated on AWS Cloud  while reviewing the AWS AI Services that can be used in combination with the Red Hat AI platform solutions to provide an approach that avoids vendor lock in.

== Fictional Use Case

A Red Hat customer reaches out because they are beginning a new generative AI project and want to know if you have any reference use cases or frameworks for organizations being their AI powered application journey. 

They are already an AWS customer but are looking for an alternative way to deploy AI models without needing data scientists or MLOps engineers. Instead a team of developers and IT operations personel will be leading this project.   The teams goal is to deliver a new chatbot service for their call center that can provide an internal only portal for associates to utilize.

The solution needs to scale to provide similar service across the organization:
 . In phase two, become a chat resource to external customers. 
 . In phase three,  it should learn from chats and request new information automatically.
