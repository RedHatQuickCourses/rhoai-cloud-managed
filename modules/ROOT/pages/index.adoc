= Red Hat AI on AWS Cloud
:navtitle: Home

== Introduction

This course is intended for Red Hat Technical Sales, Solution Architects, Support and Service team members who are discussing Red Hat AI platform solutions with customers who utilize AWS cloud services or have the flexibility to use AWS cloud services to provision such environments.

Waiting for on-premises hardware can take weeks or months, obtaining a Red Hat AI Platform from Cloud providers, AWS specifically in this course, in minutes can be a crucial component for unlocking the full potential of *generative AI* and *predictive AI* for organizations on the move.

Utilizing on-demand cloud resources to evaluate, experiment and fine tune open source  AI models to power business applications eliminates an organizations need to purchase high-cost GPUs and hardware used for model training and inference; instead consuming Red Hat AI products on an hourly basis and shutting down research and development projects when complete.

This course will focus only on Red Hat AI solutions that can be instantiated on AWS Cloud  while exploring the AWS AI Services that can be used in combination with the Red Hat AI platform solutions to provide an approach that avoids vendor lock-in.

== Fictional Use Case

A Red Hat customer reaches out because they are beginning a new generative AI project. They want to know if Red Hat has any reference use cases or frameworks for organizations beginning their AI powered application journey. 

They are an AWS customer but are looking for an alternative way to deploy AI models without needing data scientists or MLOps engineers. Instead a team of developers and IT operations personnel will be leading this project.   The team's goal is to deliver a new chatbot service for their call center that can provide an internal only portal for associates to utilize.

The solution needs to scale to provide similar service across the organization:
 . In phase two, become a chat resource to external customers. 
 . In phase three, it should learn from chats and request new information automatically.
