= Red Hat AI on AWS Cloud
:navtitle: Home

== Introduction

This course provides a comprehensive understanding of how to deploy Red Hat AI's OpenShift AI and RHEL AI products on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It covers both managed offerings and self-managed configurations when no managed service is available. In addition, this course introduces various AWS AI services such as Amazon SageMaker, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Q, and Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instances to help learners understand how these services complement Red Hat AI.

By the end of this course, learners will have a solid foundation in deploying and integrating Red Hat AI with various AWS AI Services. They will understand how to choose the right deployment model and services based on their specific use case and requirements. The course includes several sections that reference external labs where practical skills may be needed. However, it is currently missing a specific lab component showcasing the interaction between Red Hat AI and AWS AI Services in a hybrid deployment scenario. This lab will be added to provide learners with hands-on experience in deploying and managing Red Hat AI on AWS using both managed offerings and self-managed configurations while integrating various AWS AI services.
