== Course Overview

OpenShift and OpenShift AI are bridges to fill the gap between data, compute, and applications across Cloud, On-premise, and Managed environments.

Cloud providers are powering more and more opensource projects as SaaS offerings at zero cost to increase infrastructure usage. Red Hat must provide value-added services to help make Red Hat products, subscriptions, and services more compelling and valuable than competitor application and infrastructure platforms.

This course focuses on AI solution enablement for Red Hat OpenShift which powers OpenShift AI on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (Azure), IBM Cloud, and Google Cloud Platform. While all four clouds are supported, more that 80% of workloads are centered on primarily AWS with Azure's portion is growing.

The first two chapters of this course are geared towards all audiences who want to know about OpenShift in Cloud Environments.   We will review the options for OpenShift Container Platform Cluster offerings on Cloud Providers including both managed and self-managed offerings. 

The beginning two sections of this course focuses on the decisions to instantiate an OpenShift Container Cluster Platform on using fully managed Red Hat's Cloud Service offering. 

The second sections focus on AWS and Azure AI service offerings and how those might compare to OpenShift AI, if feature parity exist. 

The fifth and six chapters are labs which provide hands-on experiences with a mix of Cloud Provider Solutions and OpenShift / OpenShift AI services to solve tasks using AI assitants business use cases.  There is one lab for AWS and another for Azure.


== Duration 

Recommended budgeting three hours if you plan to complete both labs.

Overall the experience will take about 1 hour consuming course materials, however there is also ~1 hour provisioning time for each lab environment to become available. 

== Objectives

==== On completing this course, you should be able to:

  * Understand 0pen-source Play Multi-Cloud with OpenShift AI 
 ** Understand AWS options for OpenShift Container Cluster Deployment supporting OpenShift AI
 ** Understand Azure options for OpenShift Container Cluster supporting OpenShift AI
 ** Understand how OpenShift Cloud services are requested and provisioned.


==== Analyze Cloud Providers AI Platform features compared with OpenShift AI

 * Overview of AWS AI Services that offer parity with OpenShift AI functionality
  ** - SageMaker
  ** BedRock 
  ** AWS Trainium, 
  ** INferentia, 
  ** EC2 Ultra Clusters, 
  ** Amazon Q
  ** AWS App Studio, 
  ** PartyTock on Amazon BedRock

 * Overview of Azure Services and their integration with OpenShift AI. 
  ** Azure OpenAI Service
  ** Azure AI Search
  ** Azure AI Content Safety
  ** Azure AI Vision
  ** PHI Small Language Model

==== 2 Labs Environments Azure & AWS *

Azure - Interacting with Azure OpenAI Service using Front End App hosted in OpenShift 
 * expose how easy it is to run a model service on cloud provider
 * expose the cost per hour.
 * expose the time to value

AWS - starting from an OpenShift Cluster 
 ** Use GUI to installation OpenShift AI
 ** Deploy RAG Environment
 ** populate database with documentation exports
 ** Deploy AI Model Runtime

// -- updates to lab environment for serving an AI model
// -- Utilize portions of podman ai to rhoai and reference

Appendix - reference additional learning Aid 

-  GitOps Deployments of AI Services and integration with OpenShift AI ??
-  New Lab Environment created using Code Files - CLI Commands - Showing how automation would work. 



== Prerequisites

This course assumes that you have the following prior experience:

* Experience with navigating cloud provider dashboards (consoles) and service offerings
* Understanding of Cloud Provider Marketplace & Solution purchasing / accounts / billing / subscriptions
* Knowledge of Kubernetes which is the underlying technology of OpenShift and OpenShift AI

== Why This Course

Understanding how deploy, manage cost, and OpenShift AI on Hyperscales (cloud providers) by ordering Red Hat manage service offers is new to many.  Using these services customer can focus on the client needs rather
