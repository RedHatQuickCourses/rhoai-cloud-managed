= OpenShift (AI) on AWS

[NOTE]
 move to chapter 2 under AWS
 
For OpenShift AI Cloud Services the environments are mangaed by Red Hat Specialist who hangle all support and operations for the OpenShift AI platform (backend) components. 

== Deployment Options

There two types of options available for purchase of Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI):

 * Red Hat OpenShift AI self-managed
 * Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service

== Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS 

There are two available Cloud Service options avialable, with the main difference the AWS account where the services are located. 

=== Option 1: 

==== OpenShift Dedicated with a Customer Cloud Subscription on Amazon Web Services 
OpenShift Dedicated is a complete OpenShift Container Platform cluster provided as a cloud service, configured for high availability, and *dedicated* to a single customer. OpenShift Dedicated is professionally managed by Red Hat and hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model allows Red Hat to deploy and manage clusters into a customerâ€™s AWS account. 

[NOTE]
While not specifically mentioned in this course, there is also OpenShift dedicated option for Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  This is the only supported GCP offering of managed OpenShift / OpenShift AI.

=== Option 2:

==== Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA Classic)

ROSA is a fully-managed, turnkey application platform that allows you to focus on delivering value to your customers by building and deploying applications. Red Hat site reliability engineering (SRE) experts manage the underlying platform so you do not have to worry about the complexity of infrastructure management. ROSA provides seamless integration with Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and a wide range of additional AWS services to further accelerate the building and delivering of differentiating experiences to your customers.

For ROSA Classic, get a subscription through the AWS Marketplace.  You subscribe to the service directly from your AWS account. After you create clusters, you can operate your clusters with the OpenShift web console, the ROSA CLI, or through Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager.

=== Option 3 - Maybe?: 

Is it possible to combine both ROSA with HCP managed services with OpenShift AI self-managed services?

==== Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) with Hosted Control Plane
 
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS with hosted control planes (ROSA with HCP) is a fully-managed and jointly supported Red Hat OpenShift offering that combines the power of Red Hat OpenShift, the industry's most comprehensive enterprise Kubernetes platform, and the AWS public cloud. 

Hosting and managing of the control plane is accomplished via using resources (infrastructure) deployed into an Red Hat owned /managed AWS account provides. The customer only hosts worker nodes which allows the environment to scale with exactly what the customer needs providing effective and efficient use of customer resources, resulting in significant cost savings, faster provisioning time, improved security posture and increased reliability for ROSA customers. 

[WARNING]
====
OpenShift AI is not supported on ROSA with HCP as Cloud Manage Service.  However, AI workloads and applications are supported on OpenShift, and OpenShift AI self-managed can be installed by customers on ROSA with HCP.  Install OpenShift AI Self-Managed by installing the Red Hat OpenShift AI Operator and then configuring the Operator to manage standalone components of the product.


This includes support for RHOAI self-managed on managed OpenShift offerings such as OpenShift Dedicated, Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), ROSA with hosted control planes, and Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift. Currently, RHOAI Self-Managed is not supported on OpenShift running on other architectures (for example: ARM, IBM Power, IBM Z), and on other platforms such as OpenShift Kubernetes Engine, single node OpenShift, and MicroShift.

== Managed Offering Benefits

The OpenShift AI Cloud Services is a fully managed service, enabling customer to spin up OpenShift AI environments on cloud platforms enabling access to OpenShift AI features at hourly rates.  The ability to quickly use a common tool sets across cloud for Generative and Predecitive AI application and solution develop solves the gap of need to be an openshift customer.  Customer can experience OpenShift AI features available rapidly for proof of concepts and development and non-sensitive data lab environments.

No specific lab exist for this segment, however this environment provides an example of ROSA deployed instance of RHOAI if your interested in understanding ROSA from a customer point of view.

You can use this base environment for creating and running RHODS related use cases on ROSA.]
