== Objectives

 * Understanding Amazon SageMaker
 * Optional - Get Hands on with Amazon SageMaker domain


[NOTE]
This is a full featured MLOps platform most similar to OpenShift AI.  The primary workflow is the same, data preparation, model training, model deployment for AI powered applications.

== What is Amazon SageMaker? 

A tool for Data Scientists, Developers, and Business Data Analysts regardless of their ML expertise to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows.

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that brings together a broad set of tools to enable high-performance, low-cost machine learning (ML) for any use case. With SageMaker, you can build, train and deploy ML models at scale using tools like notebooks, debuggers, profilers, pipelines, MLOps, and more â€“ all in one integrated development environment (IDE). 

SageMaker supports governance requirements with simplified access control and transparency over your ML projects. In addition, you can build your own Foundation Models (FMs), large models that were trained on massive datasets, with purpose-built tools to fine-tune, experiment, retrain, and deploy FMs. 

//SageMaker offers access to hundreds of pretrained models, including publicly available FMs, that you can deploy with just a few clicks.

Sage Maker Studio is the dashboard product used to interact with this Cloud Service and access machine learning models from a variety of model providers.

== Lab Exercise:

=== Demo Platform Lab Environment

Launch an AWS Blank Open Environment to follow along with this guided lab.

https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?search=AWS+Blank+Open+Environment&item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fsandboxes-gpte.sandbox-open.prod[AWS Blank Open Environment, window=blank]

This lab environment can take up to 20 minutes to become available, however it's usually available in a few minutes. 

=== Logon to the AWS Console and open SageMaker

 . Use the link and credentials provided by Demo Hub to Logon to the AWS Console.
 . Use the search bar to search for *sagemaker*.
 . Under service click the *Amazon SageMaker* tile to open Amazon SageMaker.
 . Explore the SageMaker home page.


CLick on Setup Domain

Click on Setup Domain
 . In SageMaker, a domain is an environment for your team to access SageMaker resources. A domain consists of a list of authorized users and users within a domain can share notebook files and other artifacts with each other. One account can have either one or multiple domains.

Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic is a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for machine learning (ML). Studio Classic lets you build, train, debug, deploy, and monitor your ML models. Studio Classic includes all of the tools you need to take your models from data preparation to experimentation to production with increased productivity. In a single visual interface, you can do the following tasks:

Write and run code in Jupyter notebooks

Prepare data for machine learning

Build and train ML models

Deploy the models and monitor the performance of their predictions

Track and debug ML experiments

Collaborate with other users in real time

Amazon SageMaker uses domains to organize user profiles, applications, and their associated resources. An Amazon SageMaker domain consists of the following:

An associated Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume

A list of authorized users

A variety of security, application, policy, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) configurations


Summary:

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service. With Amazon SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly build and train machine learning models, and then deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment.
