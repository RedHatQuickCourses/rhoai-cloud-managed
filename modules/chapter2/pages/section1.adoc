  export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=`aws sts get-caller-identity \
    --query Account --output text`
  export REGION=us-east-2

Make you your ROSA CLI version is correct (v1.2.25 or higher)

   --region ${REGION} --mode auto --yes

Watch the install logs

 rosa logs install -c $ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME --watch --tail 10

Validate the cluster
Once the cluster has finished installing we can validate we can access it

Create an Admin user


Copy
 rosa create admin -c $ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME

Wait a few moments and run the oc login command it provides. If it fails, or if you get a warning about TLS certificates, wait a few minutes and try again.

Run oc whoami --show-console, browse to the provided URL and log in using the credentials provided above.

Cleanup
 Delete the ROSA cluster


 rosa delete cluster -c $ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME
 Clean up the STS roles

Once the cluster has been deleted we can delete the STS roles.
