= Amazon Bedrock

== Objectives

 * Explain how Bedrock is unique in the AWS AI model space
 * Understand when Openshift AI and RHEL AI products solutions are applicable.


[NOTE]
This is a model serving platform similar to RHEL AI, rather than using open source models Amazon Bedrock allows customers to access instances of foundation models from leading third party providers such as Anthropic, AI21 Labs, Stability AI, and Amazon via a single API.

== What is Amazon Bedrock?

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. 

Using Amazon Bedrock, you can easily experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources. 

Since Amazon Bedrock is serverless, you don't have to manage any infrastructure, and you can securely integrate and deploy generative AI capabilities into your applications using the AWS services you are already familiar with.
