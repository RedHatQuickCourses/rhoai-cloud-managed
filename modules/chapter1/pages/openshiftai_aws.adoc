= OpenShift (AI) on AWS
 
OpenShift AI Cloud Service provides a turnkey platform environment managed by Red Hat Specialist who handle all support and operations for the OpenShift AI platform (backend) components. 

Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service is a fully managed service enabling access to OpenShift AI features at hourly rates.  The ability to quickly use a common platform and tool set across clouds or on-premises for generative and predictive AI application and solution development solves the gap of training or hiring engineers with multiple skill sets.  Customers can experience common OpenShift AI features across locations rapidly for proof of concepts, development, data processing, and AI model lab and production environments.

== OpenShift AI on AWS

There two subscription options available that provide support for Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) on AWS:

 * Red Hat OpenShift AI self-managed
 * Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service

== Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service on AWS 

There are two available Cloud Service subscriptions, with the main difference being the AWS account where the services are located. 

=== Option 1: 

==== OpenShift Dedicated with a Customer Cloud Subscription on Amazon Web Services 
OpenShift Dedicated is a complete OpenShift Container Platform cluster provided as a cloud service, configured for high availability, and *dedicated* to a single customer. OpenShift Dedicated is professionally managed by Red Hat and hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model allows Red Hat to deploy and manage clusters into a customerâ€™s AWS account. 

[NOTE]
While not specifically mentioned in this course, there is also an OpenShift AI dedicated option for Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  This is the only supported GCP offering of managed OpenShift / OpenShift AI.

=== Option 2:

==== Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA Classic)

ROSA is a fully-managed, turnkey application platform that allows you to focus on delivering value to your customers by building and deploying applications. Red Hat site reliability engineering (SRE) experts manage the underlying platform so you do not have to worry about the complexity of infrastructure management. 

ROSA provides seamless integration with Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and a wide range of additional AWS services to further accelerate the building and delivering of differentiating experiences to customers.

For ROSA Classic, customers get a subscription through the AWS Marketplace.  They subscribe to the service directly from their AWS account. After cluster creation, customers can operate their clusters with the OpenShift web console, the ROSA CLI, or through Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager.

=== Option 3 - Combination of Cloud Service with Self-Managed 

This is not an officially offered option, however, it maybe possible to combine both ROSA with HCP managed services with OpenShift AI self-managed services.

==== Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) with Hosted Control Plane
 
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS with hosted control planes (ROSA with HCP) is a fully-managed and jointly supported Red Hat OpenShift offering that combines the power of Red Hat OpenShift, the industry's most comprehensive enterprise Kubernetes platform, and the AWS public cloud. 

Hosting and management of the control plane is accomplished *using resources (infrastructure) deployed into a Red Hat owned / managed AWS Account*. The customer only hosts worker nodes in their AWS Account which allows the environment to scale with exactly what the customer needs providing effective and efficient use of customer resources, resulting in significant cost savings, faster provisioning time, improved security posture and increased reliability for ROSA customers. 

[WARNING]
====
OpenShift AI is not supported on ROSA with HCP as Cloud Manage Service.  However, AI workloads and applications are supported on OpenShift, and OpenShift AI self-managed can be installed by customers who subscribe to ROSA with HCP.  With an additional subscription,  the OpenShift AI Add-on and then installing OpenShift AI Self-Managed by installing the Red Hat OpenShift AI Operator customers can fully flexible OpenShift AI platform.

== Experiment with OpenShift AI on ROSA

No specific lab exists for this segment, however this environment provides an example of a ROSA deployed instance of RHOAI if you are interested in understanding ROSA from a customer point of view.

 Now let's discuss RHEL AI on AWS.
