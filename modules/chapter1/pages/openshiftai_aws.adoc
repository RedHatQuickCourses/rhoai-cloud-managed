= OpenShift (AI) on AWS

== Objectives

 * Comprehend the benefit of managed services
 * Explain the customer challenges that RHOAI Cloud Service can address.
 * Understand the deployment options of Red Hat OApenShift AI cloud service
 * Explain the value / benefits of RHOAI cloud service

=== Managed Services

Before examining the OpenShift AI Cloud Service, let's define the what is meant by a managed infrastructure services. 

A managed service infrastructure is the transfer of an organization's IT infrastructure management to an external Managed Service Provider (MSP). The MSP provides ongoing support and administration for the organization's network, applications, infrastructure, and security.

The *OpenShift AI Cloud Service* shifts the burden of managing the RHOAI infrastructure platform and software updates to Red Hat and partner providers. This allows teams to focus on building and supporting the applications that move the needle for the organization rather than supporting the infrastructure.

As an example, rather than engineers spending time to build the factory, they can use the managed service (factory) to produce the goods and services to be sold.  

In our FictionCorp Scenario, instead of building the platform to run, train or serve AI models, development and IT operations engineers can focus on providing the new chat application.

Organizations can quickly configure the RHOAI platform services via DevOps CI/CD practices or allow teams to self-service RHOAI resources via the included dashboard. 


=== Customer challenges that RHOAI Cloud Service can address

==== Data Privacy Concerns 

Increase in open source model options provides the opportunity for more control over data and cost.   Ability to deploy models across multiple environments from on-premises to cloud enables a mitigation of concerns about resource utilization and optimization.  Stay in control of your data by keeping it within your organizations acccounts.

OpenShift AI Cloud Services can run within your AWS accounts, allow your organization to stay in control of the data available to AI models.  

Many customers lack the expertise needed to switch models and optimize for specific use cases with the ever expanding and evolving technology makes model selection and lifecycles difficult to scale and manage.  Companies moving from POC stages to pilots and production environments often struggle with the burdens of operationalizing AI Models lifecycle management actions such as model viability, security, cost, and agility. 

Openshift AI Cloud Services is trusted open source offering that provides a bring your own model machine learning operations platofrm environment.  Organizations can easily version, manage, train, and infere AI models using RHOAI Cloud Service.

There are significant cost to run the Large Language Models that power the services provided by the AI Model SaaS service leaders such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.  
 
Cloud with Red Hat AI creates opportunities to experiment, pilot, and implement new solutions using on-demand hardware and software solutions rather than committing to huge cost investments without validated solutions allowing  meaningful production deployment.


//Cloud Providers incentive is to make it easy to consume more resources.

//FY24 saw customers moving gen AI projects out of Proof of Concepts, largely performed using hyperscaler services, into pilot and production. In that move, customers realized the generalized hyperscaler AI services may not provide enough value to the business and had highly variable and unpredictable costs.

//During this time, the quantity and quality of viable open and permissively licensed models (ie Llama, Mistral) greatly increased, leading customers to explore private deployments of gen AI vs using hyperscaler services.

//Ability to support customer owned systems across hybrid cloud footprints for container, virtualization and AI workloads on a single enterprise platform (OpenShift),
 

== OpenShift AI on AWS

OpenShift AI Cloud Service provides a turnkey platform environment managed by Red Hat Specialist who handle all support and operations for the OpenShift AI platform (backend) components. 

Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service is a fully managed service enabling access to OpenShift AI features at hourly rates.  The ability to quickly use a common platform and tool set across clouds or on-premises for generative and predictive AI application and solution development solves the gap of training or hiring engineers with multiple skill sets.  Customers can experience common OpenShift AI features across locations rapidly for proof of concepts, development, data processing, and AI model lab and production environments.

There two subscription options available that provide support for Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) on AWS:

 * Red Hat OpenShift AI self-managed
 * Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service

== Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service on AWS 

There are two available Cloud Service subscriptions, with the main difference being the AWS account where the services are located. 

=== Option 1: 

==== OpenShift Dedicated with a Customer Cloud Subscription on Amazon Web Services 
OpenShift Dedicated is a complete OpenShift Container Platform cluster provided as a cloud service, configured for high availability, and *dedicated* to a single customer. OpenShift Dedicated is professionally managed by Red Hat and hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model allows Red Hat to deploy and manage clusters into a customerâ€™s AWS account. 

[NOTE]
While not specifically mentioned in this course, there is also an OpenShift AI dedicated option for Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  This is the only supported GCP offering of managed OpenShift / OpenShift AI.

=== Option 2:

==== Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA Classic)

ROSA is a fully-managed, turnkey application platform that allows you to focus on delivering value to your customers by building and deploying applications. Red Hat site reliability engineering (SRE) experts manage the underlying platform so you do not have to worry about the complexity of infrastructure management. 

ROSA provides seamless integration with Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and a wide range of additional AWS services to further accelerate the building and delivering of differentiating experiences to customers.

For ROSA Classic, customers get a subscription through the AWS Marketplace.  They subscribe to the service directly from their AWS account. After cluster creation, customers can operate their clusters with the OpenShift web console, the ROSA CLI, or through Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager.

=== Option 3 - Combination of Cloud Service with Self-Managed 

This is not an officially offered option, however, it may be possible to combine both ROSA with HCP managed services with OpenShift AI self-managed services.

==== Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) with Hosted Control Plane
 
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS with hosted control planes (ROSA with HCP) is a fully-managed and jointly supported Red Hat OpenShift offering that combines the power of Red Hat OpenShift, the industry's most comprehensive enterprise Kubernetes platform, and the AWS public cloud. 

Hosting and management of the control plane is accomplished *using resources (infrastructure) deployed into a Red Hat owned / managed AWS Account*. The customer only hosts worker nodes in their AWS Account which allows the environment to scale with exactly what the customer needs providing effective and efficient use of customer resources, resulting in significant cost savings, faster provisioning time, improved security posture and increased reliability for ROSA customers. 

[WARNING]
====
OpenShift AI is not supported on ROSA with HCP as Cloud Manage Service.  However, AI workloads and applications are supported on OpenShift, and OpenShift AI self-managed can be installed by customers who subscribe to ROSA with HCP.  With an additional subscription,  the OpenShift AI Add-on and then installing OpenShift AI Self-Managed by installing the Red Hat OpenShift AI Operator, customers can fully use the OpenShift AI platform.

== Experiment with OpenShift AI on ROSA

No specific lab exists for this segment, however this environment provides an example of a ROSA deployed instance of RHOAI if you are interested in understanding ROSA from a customer point of view.

 Now let's discuss RHEL AI on AWS.
