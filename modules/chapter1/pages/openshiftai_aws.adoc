= OpenShift (AI) on AWS

== Objectives

 * Understand the deployment options of *Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service*
 * Explain the value / benefits of RHOAI Cloud Service
 * Explain the customer challenges that RHOAI Cloud Service can address


== OpenShift AI Cloud Service

There two subscription options available that provide entitlements for Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) on AWS:

 * Red Hat OpenShift AI Self-Managed
 * Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service 

OpenShift AI Cloud Service provides a turnkey platform environment managed by Red Hat Specialist who handle all support and operations for the OpenShift AI platform (backend) components. 

Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service is a fully managed service enabling access to OpenShift AI features at committed usage or hourly rates.  The ability to use a common platform and tool set across hyperscalers or on-premises for generative and predictive AI applications and solution development solves the gap of training or hiring engineers with multiple skill sets.  Customers can experience common OpenShift AI features across locations rapidly for proof of concepts, development, data processing, and AI model production environments.

RHOAI Cloud Service is supported on OpenShift Dedicated (AWS and GCP) and on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA). Currently, RHOAI Cloud Service is currently not supported on Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift and ROSA with hosted control planes.

== Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service on AWS 

There are two supported Cloud Service subscriptions for OpenShift which is a requirement for OpenShift AI:

=== Option 1: 

==== OpenShift Dedicated with a Customer Cloud Subscription on Amazon Web Services 
OpenShift Dedicated is a complete OpenShift Container Platform cluster provided as a cloud service, configured for high availability, and *dedicated* to a single customer. OpenShift Dedicated is professionally managed by Red Hat and hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

Customers that want to use Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) with Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated (OSD) will deploy OSD into their existing AWS (Amazon Web Services) or GCP (Google Cloud Platform) account using the Customer Cloud Subscription on AWS or Customer Cloud Subscription on GCP model. In this model customers will pay AWS or GCP for the underlying infrastructure and Red Hat for OpenShift Dedicated.

[NOTE]
While not specifically mentioned in this course, there is also an OpenShift AI dedicated option for Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  This is the only supported GCP offering of managed OpenShift / OpenShift AI.




=== Option 2:

==== Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA)

For ROSA classic, clients procure a subscription via the AWS Marketplace using their AWS account. Following cluster creation, they can manage their clusters through the OpenShift web console, ROSA CLI, or Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager.

ROSA classic is an all-encompassing, preconfigured application platform designed to help businesses concentrate on delivering superior value to their clients by developing and deploying applications. The Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team manages the underlying infrastructure, thereby alleviating the burden of intricate infrastructure management for clients.

ROSA seamlessly integrates with Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and a multitude of other AWS services to expedite the creation and delivery of customized experiences to customers

=== Customer challenges that RHOAI Cloud Service can address


==== Updates and Upgrades
Updates and upgrades of the Red Hat OpenShift AI service will be automatically rolled out to clusters by our SRE team. In general, we don’t expect any disruptions of service with these updates, but we will notify customers in advance if we anticipate any downtime.

Updates to the OpenShift Dedicated service may impact data science users if there are active notebook sessions. To minimize potential business impact, the cluster administrator might want to set the update strategy setting to ‘Manual’ so updates can be applied at an appropriate time for the business.

==== Availability
Red Hat maintains a 99.95% availability for its managed services, including the underlying OpenShift Dedicated or Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS managed environment. Note that the availability service agreements only apply if the dashboard is configured with 2 or more replicas.

==== Support
As a premium offering by Red Hat, customers have full access to the Red Hat Customer Portal with 24x7 production support. To achieve the best resolutions, customers should open a case whenever they have a question or issue. When opening a support case for the Red Hat OpenShift AI Service, select the product named “Red Hat OpenShift AI”.

The Red Hat OpenShift AI service also supports model deployment through options such as exporting the model for hosting in another environment.

//When administrators install and configure the Red Hat OpenShift AI service, it is automatically distributed to customer Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated compute nodes. Currently, there is no way to control to which nodes the overall service is distributed. However, if the cluster supports GPUs, the service will ensure GPU workloads utilize GPU nodes. This is addressed as part of the service delivery rather than as a customer configuration option.

==== Data Privacy Concerns 

// Ability to deploy models across multiple environments from on-premises to cloud enables a mitigation of concerns about resource utilization and optimization.  Stay in control of your data by keeping it within your organization's accounts.

OpenShift AI Cloud Services can run within your AWS accounts, allowing your organization to stay in control of the data available to AI models.  

//Companies moving from POC stages to pilots and production environments often struggle with the burdens of operationalizing AI Models lifecycle management actions such as model viability, security, cost, and agility. 



== Summary

Openshift AI Cloud Services is a trusted open source offering that provides a bring your own model machine learning operations platform environment.  Organizations can easily version, manage, train, and inference solutions from AI / ML models using RHOAI Cloud Service.

OpenShift AI Cloud Service provides a turnkey platform environment managed by Red Hat Specialist who handle all support and operations for the OpenShift AI platform components. 

As the number and caliber of open-source and permissively licensed models (such as Llama, Mistral, and IBM Granite) grew significantly during this period, organizations started considering private deployments of generative AI instead of relying on hyperscaler services.

Openshift AI Cloud Services is a trusted open source offering that provides a bring your own model machine learning operations platform environment.  Organizations can easily version, manage, train, and inference solutions from AI / ML models using RHOAI Cloud Service.
