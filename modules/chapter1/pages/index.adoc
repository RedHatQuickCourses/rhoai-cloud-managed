= Red Hat AI on AWS Cloud

In this chapter we'll analyze Red Hat AI deployment options on Amazon Web Services.  

== Terminology Review

For those not familiar with the *Red Hat AI Platform* or simply *Red Hat AI*,  it's comprised of:

 * Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI)
 * Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI)

*RHEL AI* is targeted towards customers who are looking for a generative AI model fine tuning and model inferencing solution based on industry trusted Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) that can be run on cloud hyperscalers or on premise hardware providing a hybrid cloud experience for organizations.

*RHOAI* - is a fully scalable Machine Learning Operations Platform (MLOps) that provides the ability to automate data collection, processing and preparation. Then automate model experimentation, training, and versioning using pipelines. Finally provide AI model inference securely, with OpenShift Container Platform  (OCP) providing the infrastructure to run AI powered applications.  A RHEL AI entitlement is included with Red Hat OpenShift AI. 

*OpenShift AI Cloud Service* shifts the burden of managing the RHOAI infrastructure platform and software updates to Red Hat and partner providers. This allows teams to focus on building and supporting the applications that move the needle for the organization rather than supporting the infrastructure.

For those not familiar with the hyperscale service providers:

*AWS stands for Amazon Web Services* - which is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that offers a wide range of services like computing power, storage, databases, analytics, and more, allowing users to access and manage IT resources online without having to own physical hardware; essentially, it's a way to build and run applications on the internet without managing your own servers.

*Managed infrastructure Service* - A managed infrastructure service is the transfer of an organization's IT infrastructure management to an external Managed Service Provider (MSP). The MSP provides ongoing support and administration for the organization's network, applications, infrastructure, and security.

*Hyperscalers* provide cloud computing and data management services to organizations that require vast infrastructure for large-scale data processing and storage. While there is no universal standard for what should be classified as a hyperscaler, major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud fit the description.

Now let's explore Red Hat AI and AWS in the Cloud.
