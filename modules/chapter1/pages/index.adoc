= Red Hat AI on AWS Cloud

In this chapter we'll analyze Red Hat AI deployment options on Amazon Web Services.  

== Terminology Review

==== Getting Started with Red Hat AI:  

*RHEL AI* is targeted towards customers who are looking for a generative AI model fine tuning and model inferencing solution based on industry trusted Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) that can be run on cloud hyperscalers or on premise hardware providing a hybrid cloud experience for organizations.

*RHOAI* - (OpenShift AI) is a fully scalable Machine Learning Operations Platform (MLOps) that provides the ability to automate data collection, processing and preparation. Then automate model experimentation, training, and versioning using pipelines. Finally, it provides AI model inference securely, with OpenShift Container Platform  (OCP) providing the infrastructure to run AI powered applications.  A RHEL AI entitlement is included with Red Hat OpenShift AI. 

With the *Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service*, the burden of managing the RHOAI infrastructure platform and software updates is transferred to Red Hat and its partners. This frees up your team to focus on creating and supporting applications that drive business value, rather than investing time and resources in infrastructure management.

==== If you're new to Hyperscale Cloud Services:

*AWS stands for Amazon Web Services* - which is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that offers a wide range of services like computing power, storage, databases, analytics, and more, allowing users to access and manage IT resources online without having to own physical hardware; essentially, it's a way to build and run applications on the internet without managing your own servers.

*Managed Infrastructure Service* - A managed infrastructure service is the transfer of an organization's IT infrastructure management to an external Managed Service Provider (MSP). The MSP provides ongoing support and administration for the organization's network, applications, infrastructure, and security.

*Hyperscalers* - provide cloud computing and data management services to organizations that require vast infrastructure for large-scale data processing and storage. While there is no universal standard for what should be classified as a hyperscaler, major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud fit the description.

Now let's explore Red Hat AI and AWS in the Cloud.
