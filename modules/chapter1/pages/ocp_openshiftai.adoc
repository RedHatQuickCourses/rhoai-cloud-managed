= Red Hat AI Deployment Options on AWS

== Objectives

 * Identify Red Hat’s AI platforms that comprise Red Hat AI.
 * Describe how AWS Cloud Deployment can simplify Red Hat AI Adoption
 * Understand how to Deploy Red Hat AI Solutions on AWS
 * Explain the customer challenges that RHOAI Cloud Service can address.


== Red Hat AI Platform

Red Hat AI Platform includes both RHEL AI and OpenShift AI. While RHEL AI can be installed without any dependpendcies, RHOAI is an add-on feature set to OpenShift Container Platform clusters. 

RHEL AI is specially designed for open-source Generative AI model fine tuning and inference.

OpenShift AI is fully functionaly MLOPs platform which is capabile of providing life cycle mangagement for both predictive and genertaive AI solutions.

Depending on an organization maturity in AI model powered application development, both solutions provide a entry points into AI solutions with RHEL AI focus on those earlier in the journey, and OpenShift AI focused on solving the enterprise multi AI model production applications at scale.

While this course focuses on AWS deployments, either of these solutions can be deployed across multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments known as and disconnected or air-gapped environment known as Private AI.

As mentioned this course focuses on Red Hat AI on AWS Cloud, so let's learn about the benefits of  OpenShift AI Cloud Service on AWS.


== OpenShift AI on AWS as a managed offering

A managed services shifts the burden of managing the infrastructe and platform software to your service provides allowing teams to focus on building and supporting the applications that move the needle for the business rather than support the infrastructure.

Think of this as spending time to build the factory or using the factory to produce the good and services to be sold.  Which provides more value to the business.

Easy to configuire via DevOps CI/CD practices or allow teams to self-service RHOAI resources via the included user dashboard. 

==  TBD

Red Hat OpenShift AI is available as a fully Red Hat and AWS co-managed cloud service that is available as an add-on to:

 * Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated on AWS
 * Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA Classic)

[IMPORTANT]
Both an OpenShift and OpenShift AI add-on subscriptions are required.


=== Estimated pricing may vary per region and machine type.

OpenShift AI Add-on .022 per hour per 4vCPUs allocated.
+
OpenShift Container Cluster Platform ; $0.33/hr
OpenShift Container Cluster Platform Plus;  $0.41/hr






=== OpenShift AI Add-on Requirements


Installing OpenShift AI as a managed cloud service add-on involves the following high-level tasks:

 * Confirm that your OpenShift cluster meets all requirements.
 * Configure an identity provider for your OpenShift cluster.
 * Add administrative users for your OpenShift cluster.
 * Subscribe to the Red Hat OpenShift AI Add-on.

For OpenShift Dedicated with a CCS for AWS get a subscription through Red Hat.

[NOTE]
Customer Cloud Subscriptions (CCS) on AWS such as OpenShift Dedicated utilizes a Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model that allows Red Hat to deploy and manage clusters into a customer’s existing Amazon Web Service (AWS) account.

An OpenShift Dedicated or ROSA cluster configuration that meets the following requirements:
At least 2 worker nodes with at least 8 CPUs and 32 GiB RAM available for OpenShift AI to use when you install the Add-on. If this requirement is not met, the installation process fails to start and an error is displayed.

When you create a new cluster, select m6a.2xlarge for the computer node instance type to satisfy the requirements.

[NOTE]
You can also purchase Red Hat OpenShift AI as self-managed software. To purchase a new subscription, contact your Red Hat account manager. If you do not yet have an account manager, complete the form at https://www.redhat.com/en/contact to request one.
