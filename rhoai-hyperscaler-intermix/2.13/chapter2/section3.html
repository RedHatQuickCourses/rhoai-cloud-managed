<p>What is AWS Deep Learning AMIs?
Deep learning AMIs provide customized machine images preconfigured with deep learning frameworks, NVIDIA CUDA, cuDNN, and Jupyter notebook server for distributed training.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learning about deep learning – DLAMI is a great choice for learning or teaching machine learning and deep learning frameworks. The DLAMIs take away the headache from troubleshooting the installations of each framework and getting them to play along on the same computer. The DLAMIs include a Jupyter notebook and make it easy to run the tutorials that the frameworks provide for people new to machine learning and deep learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>App development – If you&#8217;re an app developer who&#8217;s interested in using deep learning to make your apps utilize the latest advances in AI, then DLAMI is the perfect test bed for you. Each framework comes with tutorials on how to get started with deep learning, and many of them have model zoos that make it easy to try out deep learning without having to create the neural networks yourself or to do any of the model training. Some examples show you how to build an image detection application in just a few minutes, or how to build a speech recognition app for your own chatbot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Machine learning and data analytics – If you&#8217;re a data scientist or you&#8217;re interested in processing your data with deep learning, then you&#8217;ll find that many of the frameworks have support for R and Spark. You will find tutorials on how to do simple regressions, all the way up to building scalable data processing systems for personalization and predictions systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Research – If you&#8217;re a researcher who wants to try out a new framework, test a new model, or train new models, then DLAMI and AWS capabilities for scale can alleviate the pain of tedious installations and management of multiple training nodes.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Trn1 instances, powered by AWS Trainium chips, are purpose built for high-performance deep learning (DL) training of generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and latent diffusion models. Trn1 instances offer up to 50% cost-to-train savings over other comparable Amazon EC2 instances. You can use Trn1 instances to train 100B+ parameter DL and generative AI models across a broad set of applications, such as text summarization, code generation, question answering, image and video generation, recommendation, and fraud detection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The AWS Neuron SDK helps developers train models on AWS Trainium (and deploy models on the AWS Inferentia chips). It integrates natively with frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, so that you can continue using your existing code and workflows to train models on Trn1 instances. To learn about the current Neuron support for machine learning (ML) frameworks and libraries, model architectures, and hardware optimizations, see the Neuron documentation.</p>

<p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Inf2 instances are purpose built for deep learning (DL) inference. They deliver high performance at the lowest cost in Amazon EC2 for generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. You can use Inf2 instances to run your inference applications for text summarization, code generation, video and image generation, speech recognition, personalization, fraud detection, and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inf2 instances are powered by AWS Inferentia2, the second-generation AWS Inferentia chip. Inf2 instances raise the performance of Inf1 by delivering 3x higher compute performance, 4x larger total accelerator memory, up to 4x higher throughput, and up to 10x lower latency. Inf2 instances are the first inference-optimized instances in Amazon EC2 to support scale-out distributed inference with ultra-high-speed connectivity between Inferentia chips. You can now efficiently and cost-effectively deploy models with hundreds of billions of parameters across multiple chips on Inf2 instances.</p>
