This course is intended for Red Hat Technical Sales, Solution Architects, Support and Service team members who are discussing Red Hat AI platform managed solutions with customers who utilize AWS cloud services.

Utilizing reserved or on-demand cloud resources to evaluate, experiment and fine tune open source  AI models to power business applications eliminates an organizations need to purchase high-cost GPUs and hardware used for model training and inference; instead consuming Red Hat AI products on AWS at an hourly basis or yearly agreements allows flexibility of adjusting resource allocations for research and development projects when complete.

This course will focus only on Red Hat AI solutions that can be instantiated on AWS Cloud while also providing a brief overview of  AWS AI Services that can be used in combination with the Red Hat AI platform solutions.
